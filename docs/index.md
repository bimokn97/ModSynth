# ModSynth

## What is ModSynth?

ModSynth is a documentation of my journey to build a modular synthesizer.
I have a background in physics, but have never been completely comfortable with
a lot of analog electronics. OpAmps? Sure, but long-tailed pairs? Brrrr...

Furthermore, I enjoy making music and have been playing - among other things - with VCV.
I'd love to start with some Eurorack modules, but they are prohibitively expensive.
I do however have a lot of components and all the tools to build everything myself.
